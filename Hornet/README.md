Summary
Remix of Hornet's head from WalRit's Hollow Knight & Hornet.

To make a wearable mask, I did the following:
1) increased the size of the head
2) hollowed out the interior
3) cut out the back
4) cut out eyeholes

Significant slicing necessary to print on a Prusa MK3S+. Supports necessary.

.3mf file with suggested slicing included.
